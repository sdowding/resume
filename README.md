## 👨‍💻 What I'm up to

I'm currently putting my 21+ years of experience to work upleveling KOHO's tech processes and building the engineering culture. Since joining KOHO I have streamlined the deployment pipelines and test automation processes enabling teams of ~8 developers to deploy to prod several times a day.

Aside from that "side hustle" my main duties revolve around designing and implimnenting soltions that enable payments. Think taping your credit card, or getting your paycheque direct deposited. Those solutions are mission-critical APIs written in Go and deployed to AWS.

## 💪 My toolbox

`Go / Golang`, `JavaScript (ES6)`, `express`, `React`, `JSON`, `XML`, `CSS`, `REST`, `Unit Testing / TDD`, `PostgreSQL`, `C#`, `Jenkins`, `OpenAPI/Swagger`, `GitHub`, `Google Search`

## 💅 My passions

`CI/CD`, `Test Automation (TDD)`, `Observability`, `Pub/Sub`, `Extreme Programming (XP)`, `Pair Programming`, `Trunk Based Development`, `Owner/Operator`, `Documentatiom`, `Working Async`, `Psychological safety`, `Mentoring & Feedback`

## 💾 Experience

### Senior Backend Developer, KOHO	
###### May 2018 - Present, Toronto ON

KOHO is a Toronto based fintech focused on eliminating banking fees. It allows customers to spend cash deposits using a VISA card and pay bills.

##### Project: Migrating ████ to ██████████ (redacted)

- Currently scoping, planning, and rolling out internal API changes to enable one of the largest technical changes in KOHO's history. I'd like to say more but it's not public yet.

##### Project: Pre-Authorized Payment & Risk Replacement

- Designed, implemented, and lead the replacement of the pre-authorized payment (direct deposits) system.  
- From start to launch 3 months after my first day with no customer outages.
- Using pub/sub for loose coupling with existing payment services.
- Its goal was to replace manual payment review with a "risk engine" that can make smart decisions based on "factors".  
- The existing system could not longer scale technically or manually.

##### Project:  Company Level Contributions

- Leading-by-example to culture of collaboration and "handbook-first" documentation through mentorship, writing, and presenting.
- Currently rolling out the Innersource process to my team with the hope to have it adopted company-wide if we succeed.
- Taking solution designs to the architecture review meeting for company-level discussion and approval. Also, review proposals brought forward by other teams.
- Documented and taught testing best practices resulting in faster running, less fragile, and more valuable tests.
- Established a deployment process to deploy feature toggled changes to production removing the bottleneck on manual QA testing before deploying. We can now deploy in a completely automated process several times a day.
- Migrated my team, then the rest of the company to Trunk Based Development.
- Writing Architecture Decision Records, on solutions to pain points in the development processes that I identify.
- Hold "talks" new processes and ideas during monthly tech days.
- Introduces pair programming and mentoring for less experienced developers.
