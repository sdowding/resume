## 👨‍💻 What I'm up to

These days I'm putting my 21 years of experience to work upleveling KOHO's tech processes and building a strong engineering culture. Since joining KOHO I have streamlined the deployment and test automation processes enabling each team to deploy to prod several times a day.

Aside from that "side hustle" my main duties revolve around designing and implementing solutions that enable payments. Think taping your credit card, or getting your paycheque direct deposited. Those services are mission-critical APIs written in Go and deployed on AWS.

## 💪 My toolbox

`Go / Golang`, `JavaScript (ES6)`, `express`, `React`, `JSON`, `XML`, `CSS`, `REST`, `Unit Testing / TDD`, `PostgreSQL`, `C#`, `Jenkins`, `OpenAPI/Swagger`, `GitHub`, `DataDog`, `⭐️ Google Search`

## 💅 My passions

`CI/CD`, `Test Automation (TDD)`, `Observability`, `Pub/Sub`, `Extreme Programming (XP)`, `Pair Programming`, `Trunk Based Development`, `Owner/Operator`, `Documentatiom`, `Working Async`, `Psychological safety`, `Mentoring & Feedback`
