You can find me delivering cloud hosted web and mobile solutions for ATB Financial (probably surrounded by empty coffee cups). I'm currently focused on transforming their web and mobile online banking experiences using React, express, and a "microservices" based backend (yeah, I put microservices in "air quotes"). The project is delivered using Trunk Based Development and deployed using CI/CD with a heavy focus on test automation. I have over 20 years of experience creating digital solutions.

### 🧰 My current toolbox:

`Google Search`, `JavaScript (ES6)`, `express`, `React`, `JSON`, `XML`, `CSS`, `Responsive Design`, `REST`, `Python`, `Json Web Tokens (JWT)`, `SOAP`, `Unit Testing`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `Java`, `Jenkins`, `Bitbucket Pipelines`, `auth0`, `OpenAPI/Swagger`

### 😍 Practices I'm passionate about:

`Continuous Integration (CI)`, `Continuous Deployment (CD)`, `Test Automation (Unit Tests / e2e Test)`, `Microservices & Deployable Units`, `Static Websites`, `Monitoring and Alerting`, `Pub/Sub`, `Extreme Programming (XP)`, `Paired Programming`, `Trunk Based Development`, `Done === In-Production`, `Owner/Operator`
